This project explores social media network dynamics using graph theory techniques in Python. By leveraging the NetworkX library, it analyzes user interactions to identify key influencers, understand community structures, and uncover interaction patterns.


**Key Features:**

**Graph Construction:**  Created a graph from user interaction data, representing relationships as edges and users as nodes.


**Centrality Metrics:**

**Degree Centrality:** Users with the highest number of connections.

**Betweenness Centrality:** Users bridging different communities.

**Closeness Centrality:** Users who can reach others quickly within the network.


**Community Detection:** Applied Greedy Modularity algorithm to detect clusters of closely connected users.


**Interaction Analysis:** Identified the most frequent interaction types within the network.


**Applications:**

**Influencer Identification:** Discover influential users for marketing or outreach campaigns.

**Community Insights:** Understand user groups and engagement patterns to foster community growth.

**Social Network Management:** Gain actionable insights into interaction and connectivity.
